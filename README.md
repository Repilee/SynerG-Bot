# SynerG-Bot
**Setting up the bot**

First, attempt to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Second, go to command prompt and type in:
```
npm install discord.js

npm install moment

npm install chalk

npm install return-deep-diff

npm install fs

npm install winston

npm install util

npm install youtube-node
```

If you've cloned it into your user directory's documents folder, just open the batch file in the repo to get started.

If you've relocated the repo from that location, you will need to edit the path so that the batch file executes the bot correctly.
